Define the output structure of the convolutional layers based on the given stride.

For each of the programming subtasks 2-4 point out the changes that happen to the accuracy and error and explain why your modifications caused those changes.


All run with 10K iterations: 

1, Setup the network layer with 3 conv layers, 1 relu layer and 1 softmax layer with a GradientDescentOptimizer.
	Loss => 0.34355
	Accuracy => 0.8782

2. Change the optimizer to the AdamOptimizer.
	Loss => 0.336395
	Accuracy => 0.8852
	See task4_pt2.png

3. Add a learning decay to the network.
	Loss => 0.313124
	Accuracy => 0.8906
